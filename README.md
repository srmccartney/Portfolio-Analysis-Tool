# Portfolio-Analysis-Tool
The goal of this project is to create a comprehensive tool that allows the user to input their portfolio allocation (tickers & weights) and output a myriad of useful statistical insights as well as a Monte Carlo simulation of what the future may hold assuming the return and standard deviation continue as they have in the past. Factor data is pulled from Kenneth French's maintained data library. Security data is pulled from Yahoo Finance.
